and i forgot to say, i'm not a developer and i don't know how to program, i just deployed this code with a new bar named: Images, with this new bar you can put links (image) of the site without add them into the description or other bar, and this code has two problems remaining


1° Problem: the date, the file is not static, so if you keep restarting the page of the file you will see that the date keep updating (Status: without solution)

2° Problem: when the code generate the file, it generate with php code inside of it, and not <xml>, you will see when create the feed for a website and download the file, and open the editor (status: without solution)
